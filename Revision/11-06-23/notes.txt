this keyword:
this means object
outside the function - this will refer to window object
Method - this will refer to current object 
simple function - this will to undefined 
arrow function - it will not have own this keyword it will borrow from surrounding function
Global execution context is the first function that will be executed
function is also object in javascript
================================================
Hoisting:
In javascript some types of variables is accessible in the code before execution.
example 
addition();
function addition(){

}
Global execution context will be created before execution phase and here you will have 
all varibles declares and function entry point 
Hositing:
1.normal function declaration 
2.var keyword 
3.let and const hositing not possible 
4.function expression with var is possible and with let & const is not possible.
=====================================================
Temporal Dead zone 
1.Accessing any variable before declaration is a bad practice and should be avoided.
example:
<!-- <script>
    console.log(firstName);
    let firstName = "akash";
 </script> -->

 <!-- <script>
    console.log(firstName);
    const firstName = "akash";
 </script> -->
 ============================================================
 Closures:
 //A Closure is a feature of javascript that allows inner functions to access the outer scope of a function.
 <script>
    function display(){
        let firstName = "akash";
          function inner(){
               return firstName;
          }
          return inner;
    }
    let result = display();
    console.log(result());
</script>
